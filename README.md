# AR-Sketch2Painting

Project for the lecture Augmented Reality

## Team members
- Lei Cheng
- Ajay Narayanan
- Haifan Zhang
- Zhenhan Gao

## Frameworks used
Unity + AR Foundation + Leapâ€™s Generative Model APIs 

## How it works
- Move the 1st marker while touching the screen to draw strokes
- Input the prompt and submit
- The API will convert the sketch to an image and display it on the 2nd marker

### 1st & 2nd marker

## Problems that may occur
Because the API needs to be paid for, we are currently using the cost-free number of times, so there may be a situation where the drawing cannot be converted to an image due to the number of times limitation
